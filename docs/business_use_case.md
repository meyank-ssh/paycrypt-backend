### E-commerce Integration Architecture

The following diagram illustrates a comprehensive implementation architecture for enterprise e-commerce platforms:

```mermaid

    subgraph "Customer Layer"
        A[Customer Browser] --> B[E-commerce Storefront]
    end
    
    subgraph "E-commerce Platform"
        B --> C[Product Catalog]
        B --> D[Shopping Cart]
        D --> E[Checkout Flow]
        E --> F[Payment Gateway Selection]
        F --> G[Crypto Payment Option]
    end

        H --> I[Order Creation]
        I --> J[Payment Address Generation]
        J --> K[QR Code Display]
        K --> L[Payment Monitoring]
        L --> M[Confirmation Service]
        M --> N[Order Fulfillment Trigger]
    end
    
    subgraph "Blockchain Layer"
        K --> O[Customer Wallet]
        O --> P[Blockchain Networks]
        P --> L
    end
    
    subgraph "Merchant Services"
        M --> Q[Inventory Management]
        M --> R[Shipping/Fulfillment]
        M --> S[CRM Updates]
        M --> T[Accounting System]
    end
```

#### Implementation Components

   - Determine backend webhook receivers
   - Plan database schema for order/payment mapping

2. **Technical Implementation**
   - Install SDK/plugin appropriate for platform
   - Configure API authentication credentials
   - Set up webhook endpoints and handlers
   - Implement payment status tracking logic
   - Configure inventory and fulfillment triggers

3. **Testing and Validation**

   - Set up alerts for payment processing issues

5. **Optimization and Scaling**
   - Analyze payment conversion metrics
   - Optimize checkout UX based on data
   - Implement caching for performance improvement
   - Scale webhook processing as volume increases

### Digital Services Subscription Platform

For SaaS and digital services businesses, the following integration model supports subscription-based crypto payments:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Customer
    participant Platform as Subscription Platform
    participant PaymentAPI as Payment System API
    participant Blockchain
    participant Database as Subscription Database
    
    Customer->>Platform: Select subscription plan
    Platform->>PaymentAPI: Create initial subscription payment
    PaymentAPI->>Platform: Return payment details & QR
    Platform->>Customer: Display payment options
    Customer->>Blockchain: Send initial payment
    Blockchain->>PaymentAPI: Payment confirmation
    PaymentAPI->>Platform: Webhook: Payment.Completed
    Platform->>Database: Activate subscription
    
    loop Monthly Renewal
        Platform->>PaymentAPI: Create renewal payment
        PaymentAPI->>Platform: Return payment details
        Platform->>Customer: Send renewal notification
        Customer->>Blockchain: Send renewal payment
        Blockchain->>PaymentAPI: Payment confirmation
        PaymentAPI->>Platform: Webhook: Payment.Completed
        Platform->>Database: Extend subscription period
    end
```

#### Technical Implementation Considerations

1. **Subscription Management Logic**
   - Customer subscription records with payment history
   - Renewal tracking and notification system
   - Grace period handling for delayed payments
   - Subscription tier management and upgrades

2. **Payment System Integration**
   - API integration for creating payment requests
   - Webhook handlers for payment status updates
   - Customer payment preference storage
   - Dynamic QR code generation for renewals

3. **Example API Implementation (Node.js)**

```javascript
// Example subscription payment creation
const createSubscriptionPayment = async (customerId, planId, recurring = true) => {
  const plan = await db.getSubscriptionPlan(planId);
  const customer = await db.getCustomer(customerId);
  
  // Create payment request
  const paymentRequest = {
    amount: plan.price,
    currency: customer.preferredCurrency || 'ETH',
    network: customer.preferredNetwork || 'MAINNET',
    description: `${plan.name} Subscription - ${customer.email}`,
    metadata: {
      customer_id: customerId,
      plan_id: planId,
      subscription_type: recurring ? 'recurring' : 'one-time',
      renewal_date: recurring ? 
        new Date(Date.now() + 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString() : null
    },
    webhook_url: 'https://api.yourservice.com/webhooks/crypto-payments'
  };
  
  // Call Payment System API
  const response = await axios.post(
    'https://api.paymentsystem.com/v1/payments/create-order',
    paymentRequest,
    {
      headers: {
        'X-API-Key': process.env.PAYMENT_SYSTEM_API_KEY,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    }
  );
  
  // Store payment details in database
  await db.createSubscriptionPayment({
    customerId,
    planId,
    paymentId: response.data.payment_id,
    status: 'PENDING',
    amount: plan.price,
    currency: customer.preferredCurrency || 'ETH',
    dueDate: new Date(),
    paymentAddress: response.data.payment_details.address
  });
  
  return response.data;
};
```

4. **Webhook Handler Implementation**

```javascript
// Example webhook handler for subscription payments
app.post('/webhooks/crypto-payments', async (req, res) => {
  // Verify webhook signature
  const signature = req.headers['x-payment-signature'];
  const isValid = verifySignature(req.body, signature, process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET);
  
  if (!isValid) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }
  
  const event = req.body;
  const { payment_id, status, metadata } = event.data;
  
  // Acknowledge webhook receipt immediately
  res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
  
  // Process based on event type
  if (event.event_type === 'payment.completed') {
    // Handle successful payment
    if (metadata && metadata.subscription_type === 'recurring') {
      // Update subscription record
      await db.updateSubscription({
        customerId: metadata.customer_id,
        planId: metadata.plan_id,
        status: 'ACTIVE',
        paidUntil: metadata.renewal_date,
        lastPaymentId: payment_id
      });
      
      // Trigger access provisioning
      await provisionAccess(metadata.customer_id, metadata.plan_id);
      
      // Send confirmation to customer
      await sendSubscriptionConfirmation(metadata.customer_id, metadata.plan_id);
    }
  } else if (event.event_type === 'payment.failed') {
    // Handle failed payment
    await db.updateSubscriptionPayment(payment_id, 'FAILED');
    await sendPaymentFailureNotification(metadata.customer_id);
  }
});
```

### Enterprise B2B Invoice Payments

For B2B enterprises accepting cryptocurrency for invoice payments, the integration follows this pattern:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Internal Systems"
        A[ERP System] --> B[Invoice Generation]
        B --> C[Payment Options]
    end
    
    subgraph "Payment System Integration"
        C --> D[Crypto Payment Request]
        D --> E[Payment Link Generation]
        E --> F[Client Notification]
        G[Payment Monitoring] --> H[Payment Reconciliation]
        H --> I[Invoice Settlement]
    end
    
    subgraph "Client Side"
        F --> J[Client Portal]
        J --> K[Payment Initiation]
        K --> G
    end
    
    subgraph "Financial Systems"
        I --> L[Accounting Records]
        I --> M[Tax Reporting]
        I --> N[Financial Analytics]
    end
```

#### Implementation Requirements for Enterprise B2B

1. **ERP/Accounting System Integration**
   - API connectors for major ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite)
   - Invoice data synchronization
   - Payment reconciliation automation
   - Tax and regulatory compliance handling

2. **Client-Facing Components**
   - Branded payment portal for clients
   - Multi-currency selection options
   - Payment receipt generation
   - Payment status tracking interface

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Role-based access controls for payment management
   - Segregation of duties for financial operations
   - Audit trail for compliance requirements
   - Data retention policies for financial records

    CHANGING data = ls_payment_response ).
    
  " Update SAP records with payment link
  UPDATE bkpf SET zuonr = ls_payment_response-payment_id
    WHERE belnr = iv_invoice_number
    AND bukrs = iv_company_code
    AND gjahr = iv_fiscal_year.
    
  " Create payment tracking record
  INSERT INTO zcrypto_payments VALUES @( VALUE #(
    payment_id = ls_payment_response-payment_id,
    invoice_number = iv_invoice_number,
    company_code = iv_company_code,
    fiscal_year = iv_fiscal_year,
    amount = ls_invoice_header-dmbtr,
    currency = 'ETH',
    status = 'PENDING',
    created_on = sy-datum,
    created_at = sy-uzeit,
    payment_address = ls_payment_response-payment_details-address
  ) ).
  
  " Return payment details for client communication
  rv_payment_data = ls_payment_response.
ENDMETHOD.
```
